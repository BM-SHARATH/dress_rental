            How Dress Rental Works
          </StyledTypography>
          <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
            Dress rental is a convenient and cost-effective way to access
            designer clothing for special occasions without the need to purchase
            expensive items that may only be worn once. Here's how it works:
          </Typography>
          <ul
            style={{ marginTop: "20px", lineHeight: "1.7", textAlign: "left" }}
          >
            <li>
              <strong>Browse:</strong> Browse our collection of dresses and
              choose the one that suits your style and occasion.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reserve:</strong> Reserve the dress for your desired
              rental period. You can typically rent dresses for a few days or up
              to a week, depending on your needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Try On:</strong> Once reserved, the dress will be shipped
              to your address. Try on the dress to ensure it fits perfectly and
              meets your expectations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Wear:</strong> Wear the dress to your event and enjoy
              looking stunning in designer attire.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Return:</strong> After your event, simply return the dress
              using the provided packaging and shipping label. No need to worry
              about dry cleaningâ€”we take care of that for you!
            </li>
          </ul>
          <Typography variant="body1" sx={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
            At Dress Rental, we strive to make the dress rental process as
            seamless as possible, providing high-quality designer dresses and
            excellent customer service.
